# HopeCommander - the easy to use bungeecord command bridge for anticheats!
[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/hopefuls/hopecommander/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/hopefuls/hopecommander)

This plugin is mean't as an easy to use alternative for Anticheats used in Networks that require punishment commands.
## How to install:

 1. Download the Latest Release from [here](https://github.com/Hopefuls/HopeCommander/releases).
 2. Put the .jar file on **all** Spigot-Subservers and your Bungeecord Proxy.
 3. And you're done!
 
 ## How do i use it?
 The Plugin pretty much has only one Command, which can only be used as the Console, aka your Anticheat that is going to interact with it.
 
 In order to use this Plugin, you'll need to change the Punishment Commands in your Anticheat to `/hcspigot <command>`, so for example if you're using [AdvancedBan](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/advancedban.8695/) for example, you can easily use `/hcspigot ban <player> <reason>` while of course changing the corresponding `<player>` and `<reason>` with your anticheat's placeholders.
